Title: Do you have a job for me?

In the past few weeks, I've been asked by a frankly surprising amount of folks if I had a gig for their friend/kid/coworker. I'm beyond flattered, but far from able to immediately help.

I don't have any open jobs. What I do have is opportunities. I'm a graphic designer from the 90s, so I know the mantra of NEVER WORK FOR FREE, but what about working for 50% of a company's profits?

We've got a stable of companies, running live on the internet now, that are just missing a bit of **magic**. Do you have it?

We think this might be an ideal spot for a student or intern or even a seasoned pro (maybe between gigs, looking to take ownership of something new?).

Sounds interesting? Or something like it might be a fit for someone you know? Have them [apply](/apply)!

Not looking for a role, but convinced we're on to something? We're also looking for investors and buyers, if anything here strikes your fancy...
