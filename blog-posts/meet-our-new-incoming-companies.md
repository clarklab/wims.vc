It's been a busy January, but we're not slowing down! Today, Wims.vc is thrilled to announce the addition of FOUR new properties, ready and open for business.

**Rotato:** A "hot potato" text club. One person in your group gets an SMS each day. Pick today's song. Choose the lunch spot. Share a thought. The opposite of group chat noise—one voice, one moment, real connection. [Check it out](/company/rotato)

**Checkins:** The simplest way for party hosts and event organizers to make a fun and engaging "checkin" passport to drive engagement, during and after the event. [Are you a host?](/company/checkins)

**Triage WP:** The easiest way to sort, grade, and remove or keep old WordPress content, powered by real data and a human eye. Perfect for growing teams or clients. [That you?](/company/triage-wp)

**Vibe & Tell:** Vibe coding has exploded from hobby to every developer on the planet back down to non-tech folks, and we all need a place to share our new skills. [Are you one of us?](/company/vibe-tell)
