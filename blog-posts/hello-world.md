This is a sample blog post. It's written in Markdown and has very few options. You can write simple plaintext files into GitHub and they will build out.

## This is an H2, a secondary title you can use for organization

Simply duplicate this .md file and **change things around to make a new post.** The following is some gibberish AI slop filler text. Enjoy!

Here's a template that's so minimal, it makes Marie Kondo look like a hoarder. Just markdown and dreams, folks. No fancy widgets, no JavaScript gymnasticsâ€”it's the kind of simplicity that brings a tear to a developer's eye.

In fact, this template is so lightweight, it probably counts as intermittent fasting for your server. Push to GitHub, and watch it transform into a fully-formed webpage faster than you can say "static site generator." It's like magic, minus the smoke, mirrors, and unnecessary npm packages.
