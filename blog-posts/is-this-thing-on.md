We're dusting off the blog. New year, new energy.

Here's the deal: we've got **Shell Companies** ready to launch. Products built, code deployed, payments wired. What we're missing? People who know how to get them in front of customers.

We're looking for **marketing partners** and **sales partners**. If you know how to turn traffic into revenue, how to build an audience, or how to close deals—we should talk.

Building is easy now. Distribution is the hard part. Let's solve it together.

[Get in touch](/contact) if you're interested.
