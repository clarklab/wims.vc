When you're building a startup, speed is everything. Not just the speed of execution, but the speed of learning, iterating, and getting to market. With AI agents and one-shot power, that cycle is shorter than ever.

That's why we're introducing [Challenges](#) over on [Vibe & Tell](https://vibeandtell.com). It's a quick, fun way to test you mettle, sharpern your skills, and win some killer prizes and guidance along the way.

## The Art of Shipping

Most founders get caught up in perfectionism. They want to build the perfect product before anyone sees it. But the market doesn't care about your perfect visionâ€”it cares about solving real problems. 

Each **Challenge** will feature a real-world task, with a bit of guidance and lot of room for flair. Projects will be judged by the best in the biz, a rotating cast of pros and yokels.

We've seen too many brilliant ideas die in stealth mode, never seeing the light of day because the founders were afraid to ship something imperfect. It's time to ship early, ship often, and ship in public!

We'll have more details soon. In the meantime, if you would like the sponsor an upcoming challenge, you can message [@wimbet](https://x.com/wimbet).
