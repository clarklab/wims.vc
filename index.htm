        Something happened to building companies. It used to be slides, rounds, months of meetings. <strong>Now the best ideas start as working links by dinner.</strong> We're two brothers with a few decades in the dents and ditches, we prefer proof over posture. We spin up tiny live things, that whisper yes/no before anyone writes a deck.
    </p>

        We use a lot of AI, but we won’t make a fuss about it. Think quiet superpowers: market x-rays, demand simulators, product bots that ship while we sleep. They let us test fast, kill faster, and back the survivors with time and teeth. <strong>Some of the good stuff doesn’t fit on a landing page—and that’s the point.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We’re looking for partners to run <strong>“Shell Companies,”</strong> a new kind of startup we’ve been charting. Light hulls, heavy engines, pre-wired for speed—you steer, we help with weather and fuel. Not accelerators. Not agencies. Something more feral. <strong>If you can build, sell, and keep your head when the graph lies, let’s talk.</strong>
