Description: Hot potato text club for meaningful group connections
Price: $62,000

## The Elevator Pitch

<p class="elevator-pitch">A "hot potato" text club. One person in your group gets an SMS each day. Pick today's song. Choose the lunch spot. Share a thought. The opposite of group chat noise—one voice, one moment, real connection.</p>

## The Vision

Group chats are chaos. Everyone talks, nobody listens. Rotato flips it: one person holds the potato each day. And there's no new app, simple SMS nudges to pay attention to your existing connections.

## The Opportunity

SMS credits are cheap and the IRL value prop here is OFF THE CHARTS. We've got test groups going with dozen+ members with 95% participation rate. SMS is one of the last unpoluted channels, so Rotato cuts through the noise unlike most other notification apps.
