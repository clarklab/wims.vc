Description: Figma to JSON brand style guide converter

## The Opportunity

BrandJSON turns Figma design systems into portable JSON brand packages. Design teams spend hours manually documenting brand guidelines. Developers struggle to translate design tokens into code. This automates the entire workflow.

## The Vision

- **Figma Plugin** - One-click export of design systems to structured JSON
- **Brand Packages** - Colors, typography, spacing, components as code
- **Multi-platform SDKs** - Generate React, Vue, iOS, Android themes
- **Version control** - Track brand evolution and distribute updates

## Business Model

**Revenue streams:**
- Freemium Figma plugin (free for 1 brand, $15/mo unlimited)
- API access for automated workflows ($29/mo)
- Enterprise white-label solution ($299/mo)
- Design-to-code marketplace (take 20% commission)

**Path to first revenue:**
- Build core Figma plugin (3-4 weeks)
- Launch on Figma Community
- Convert 2% of free users to paid
- Add API tier for agencies

## Market Opportunity

There are 4M+ Figma users. Every design team needs to sync design tokens with code. Current solutions (Zeroheight, Supernova) are expensive and complex. Opportunity for a simple, developer-friendly tool.

## What You Get

Domain, brand assets, and product spec. Technical architecture planned. Figma plugin framework ready. This is a greenfield opportunity for someone who wants to build a high-growth SaaS from scratch.
