## The Elevator Pitch

<p class="elevator-pitch">Create a simple and shareable public brand guide from a single Figma file.</p>

## The Vision

A single source of truth for your brands logos, colors, fonts, icons, and more. Presented in a simple web format, with full JSON support for your developers.

## The Opportunity

Design teams spend hours manually documenting brand guidelines. Developers struggle to translate design tokens into code. There are 4M+ Figma users who need to sync design tokens with code. Current solutions (Zeroheight, Supernova) are expensive and complex. Opportunity for a simple, developer-friendly tool, for a cheap monthly subscription.
