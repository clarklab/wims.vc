## The Elevator Pitch

<p class="elevator-pitch">Peel is the easiest way for people and brands to make and edit images with AI using Google's latest image model, Nano Banana Pro.</p>

## The Vision

Allow anyone to quickly access the cutting edge AI model, with no API keys or complicated setup. It's also a powerful work tool, with custom batch and preset options that makes it a better option than even the native AI Studio editor.

## The Opportunity

Most AI gateways, or direct AI API access, provides tokens at cost. Most end-user AI setup is complex. We can make that easy, and sell tokens at a slight premium, with our easier-to-use app bringing value that keeps people buying tokens.
