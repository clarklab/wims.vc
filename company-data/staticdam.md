Description: Digital asset management for static sites

## The Opportunity

StaticDAM is a modern Digital Asset Management (DAM) system built specifically for static sites and JAMstack applications. Every development team struggles with managing images, videos, and assets across CDNs. This solves that problem with a developer-first approach.

## What's Built

- **Asset pipeline** - Automatic optimization, resizing, and CDN distribution
- **Developer API** - REST + GraphQL endpoints for asset management
- **Edge-optimized** - Built on Cloudflare Workers for global performance
- **Modern stack** - Next.js frontend with real-time updates

## Business Model

**Revenue model:**
- Tiered SaaS pricing based on storage and bandwidth
- Developer tier: $19/mo (5GB storage, 50GB bandwidth)
- Team tier: $79/mo (50GB storage, 500GB bandwidth)
- Enterprise: Custom pricing

**Go-to-market:**
- Target Next.js, Gatsby, and Astro developers
- Integration marketplace (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub)
- Developer community and documentation
- Content marketing via dev.to and technical blogs

## Market Opportunity

The JAMstack market is growing 30% YoY. Every static site deployment needs asset management. Cloudinary and Imgix are expensive enterprise solutions - there's space for a developer-focused alternative.

## What You Get

Full production codebase with Cloudflare Workers backend. Next.js admin dashboard. API documentation. Ready for Stripe integration. Strong technical foundation that just needs payment setup and marketing push.
