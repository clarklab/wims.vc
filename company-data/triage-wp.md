## The Elevator Pitch

<p class="elevator-pitch">The easiest way to sort, grade, and remove or keep old WordPress content, powered by real data and a human eye.</p>

## The Vision

Most startups and large companies have a legacy WordPress website with years worth of old content. People don't care, but bots and agents hate it. It's time to clean that up.

## The Opportunity

Help teams quickly sort hundreds or THOUSANDS of WP content pages with a quick yes/no interface, something that used to take meetings and dreaded spreadsheets. I'd pay out of pocket to avoid that, and now we know others will too.
